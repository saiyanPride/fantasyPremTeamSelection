/*
Returns a sequence of goalkeeper pairs ordered by score in descending order
The ith pairing should be considered a better choice than the (i+1)th pairing

    Approach: 
    generate combinations of every possible goalkeeper pair, but generate combinations of higher scoring pairs before lower scoring pairs
    # GIVEN
    goalkeepers = {G1,G2,G3,G4 ... , Gn}
     
    result should be ranked pairs in a way that encapsulates our desire to have pairs that complement each other
    
    result will look like: [ (G1,G2), (G1,G3), (G2,G3),(G1,G4 )...]

    Example Pair and their predicted scores for next 3 Gameweeks

    Pair1
    G1: 5   5   5   5   5
    G2: 5   5   5   5   5
    predicted obtainable goalie points = 25
    sum of average pair scores = 25

    Pair2
    G1: 5   5   1   5   5
    G2: 1   5   5   5   1
    predicted obtainable goalie points = 25
    sum of average pair scores = 19

    Pair3
    G1: 5   5   1   5   5
    G2: 1   1   5   1   1
    predicted obtainable goalie points = 25
    sum of average pair scores = 15

    
    Pair4
    G1: 5   5   1   5   5
    G2: 5   5   1   5   5
    predicted obtainable goalie points = 21
    sum of average pair scores = 21
    


    # THEN 
    priority/ranking in results should match
    Pair 1 > Pair 2
    Pair 2 > Pair 3 even though they have same predicted obtainable goalie points one pair has a better back up goalkeeper in case of injury and thus has a more powerful pair
    Pair 3 > Pair 4 due to better points up for grabs, even though Pair 4 has a stronger performing pair
    
    summary:
    sort by predicted obtainable goalie points
    if tie, then sort by sum of average pair scores
    and if tie predicted obtainable goalie points per value (in Â£)
    and if still tie just pick first one (doesn't matter)
